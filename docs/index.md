Hey!

I'm Kevin Wyckmans. I'm a software engineer working [@spotify](https://spotify.com). I primarily know backend stuff, but I fiddle with a lot of different things, and am always interested in learning new things.ðŸŒ³

You've landed on my site, which I created after I got inspired by reading about digital gardens. I'll add notes and pages about topics that interest me. Some things may be blog posts, some may be collections (think bullet journal collections[](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/collections) of books, movies, and what not. I don't yet feel qualified for it, but I may even recommend a thing or two down the line.

You can get in touch with me by [email](mailto:kevinwyckmans@gmail.com), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/kwyckmans). I don't post a lot on the latter one, but I see what's coming in ðŸ™‚.

If you've got any feedback about how this is set-up, or about something I wrote, feel free to let me know, alwyas happy to improve.

There's a [list of all posts](posts.md) planted in the garden.
